# VICCP Coffee Bot
Automated coffee drinking for those pesky achievements!

**Usage**
Start VICCP and load in. Do not move your cursor to the edge as this messes with the bounds. Start with `python main.py` from the command line and return to the game.
  
**Requirements**
- python
- pyautogui:
`pip install pyautogui`

Tested and fully works on Linux. Should work fine on Windows and MacOS. If you have a monitor that is not 16:9, take  a look at the positioning settings.
